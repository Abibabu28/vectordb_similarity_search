# Privacy-Preserving Patient Similarity Search in Liver Transplant Research

A federated learning-based system for secure patient similarity search using vector db and transplant outcome analysis across multiple healthcare institutions.

## 🏥 Overview

This system enables hospitals to collaboratively identify similar liver transplant patients while preserving patient privacy. Using federated learning, vector databases, and secure multi-party computation, the system allows healthcare providers to:

- **Find similar patients** across multiple hospitals without sharing raw patient data
- **Analyze transplant outcomes** for patients with similar clinical profiles
- **Generate clinical insights** to improve transplant decision-making
- **Maintain patient privacy** through advanced cryptographic techniques



## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install torch numpy pandas scikit-learn flwr
```



### Running the Full Demo
```python
python similarity_search.py
```
